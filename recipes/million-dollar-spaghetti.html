    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup butter, sliced - divided</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container cottage cheese</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12
        minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the
        hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard
        grease. Transfer to a bowl and mix in spaghetti sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1/2 of the butter slices into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole
        dish. Spread 1/2 of the spaghetti into the dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl;
        spread mixture over spaghetti. Cover with remaining spaghetti and top
        with remaining slices of butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread in an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spread Cheddar cheese on top
        and continue baking until cheese has melted and is lightly browned,
        about 15 minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
